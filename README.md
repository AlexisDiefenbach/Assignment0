# Assignment0
First assignment:
Read the following:
Eloquent JavaScript chapter 1 http://eloquentjavascript.net/01_values.html
Eloquent JavaScript chapter 2 http://eloquentjavascript.net/02_program_structure.html I do not expect you to have a mastery of loops (for and while), updating variables succinctly (iterators), as we will be going over this in class.

I highly recommend you check out the following videos from Daniel Shiffman. We covered a lot and he takes an in depth look at what we did in context of p5.js
